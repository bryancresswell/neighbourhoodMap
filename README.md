## Lessons Learnt

Learning how to build a website from scratch that utilized AJAX requests to pull in data from other sources was an interesting experience. Problem solving was a big factor and skill that I learnt in this project as I managed to experiment and ultimately solve the bugs that I had faced. I have also managed to achieve a better understanding of the MVVM model as well as getting used to diving into documentation.
